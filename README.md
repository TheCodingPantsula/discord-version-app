## Overview
This is a full-stack web application designed to replicate Discord, a platform used for chat and voice communication among gamers and communities. The application also features team management capabilities that enhance collaboration and productivity. Currently, the app is still undergoing development and improvements before it can be deployed. I am proud of this project and would like to include it in my portfolio.

## Technologies Used
The app was built using Next.js, a React framework that enables fast and scalable web application development. It also leverages Clerk, a platform that provides authentication and user management functionalities. Additionally, Uploadthing was used for file uploading and processing, while LiveKit was used for real-time audio and video communication.

## Challenges and Solutions
During the development of this application, I encountered three primary challenges, which I resolved using the following platforms:

1. Creating a secure and user-friendly authentication system: Clerk provided various authentication methods, including passwords, email codes, OAuth, and more. It also supplied pre-built UI components for sign-in, sign-up, and user profile.

2. Enabling users to upload and share images: Uploadthing enables users to upload and share images within the app. It also provides image optimization and transformation features, such as resizing, cropping, and filtering. I integrated it and used its UI components to display the uploaded images in the app.

3. Enabling users to join and create voice rooms: LiveKit allows users to join and create voice rooms within the app. It also provides audio and video quality and reliability features, such as noise cancellation, echo cancellation, and bandwidth estimation. I integrated it and used its UI components to render the audio and video tracks in the app.
