## Overview

This is a full-stack web app that mimics Discord, a chat and voice platform for gamers and communities. It also has team management features for collaboration and productivity.

## Technologies Used

Next.js: A React framework for building fast and scalable web apps
Clerk: A platform for authentication and user management
Uploadthing: A platform for file uploading and processing
LiveKit: A platform for real-time audio and video
Challenges and Solutions
I faced three main challenges while developing this app:
Creating a secure and user-friendly authentication system
Enabling users to upload and share images
Enabling users to join and create voice rooms

## I solved these challenges by using the following platforms:

Clerk: It offers various authentication methods, such as passwords, email codes, OAuth, and more. It also provides pre-built UI components for sign-in, sign-up, and user profile.

Uploadthing: It allows users to upload and share images in the app. It also provides image optimization and transformation features, such as resizing, cropping, and filtering. I integrated it and used its UI components to display the uploaded images in the app.

LiveKit: It allows users to join and create voice rooms in the app. It also provides audio and video quality and reliability features, such as noise cancellation, echo cancellation, and bandwidth estimation. I integrated it and used its UI components to render the audio and video tracks in the app.
